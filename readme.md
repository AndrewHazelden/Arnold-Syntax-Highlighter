# Arnold Syntax Highlighter #
**Version 1** Released November 29, 2013  
by Andrew Hazelden

## Overview ##

I've just finished a set of Notepad++, GEDIT, BBEdit, and TextWrangler syntax highlighting modules for code from [Solid Angle's Arnold Renderer](http://www.solidangle.com/). The new modules makes it easier for a VFX artist or technical director to edit an Arnold scene source (.ass) file.

I hope this tool improves your coding workflow as you start working with Arnold.

Cheers,
